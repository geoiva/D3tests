<dl>
    <dt><b>Standard D3 Maps (using lon-lat geographic coordinates)</b>:</dt>
    <dd>The standard way the D3 geo methods work is with data in lon-lat geographic coordinates, being projected by <tt>d3.geo</tt>
        functions. Versatile and powerful, especially if using <tt>topojson</tt> data.
        <ul>
            <li><a href="exercise/overijssel.html">Simplest example (of municipalities of Overijssel province)</a></li>
            <li>Different projections and UI, using the same data of locations of SVGOpen &amp; GraphicalWeb conferences:</li>
            <ul>
            <li><a href="GraphicalWebCities/">Static map (SVG -- Winkel Tripel projection)</a></li>
            <li><a href="GraphicalWebCities/zoomsvg.html">Click to iterate through locations (SVG -- Orthographic projection)</a></li>
            <li><a href="GraphicalWebCities/zoom.html">Animates through locations (Canvas -- Orthographic projection)</a></li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </dd>

    <dt><a href="RDproj_test/"><b>Maps using projected meter coordinates</b>:</a></dt>
    <dd>Map a geojson with cartesian coordinates, instead of lat-lon's (in this case the Dutch RD) --
        Uses an override of standard D3 geo projection behaviour:
        don't perform a full projection and resampling, but only a 1st order (affine) translation and
        scaling to transform real-world XY-coordinates into SVG screen coordinates...<br/>
        Includes auto-scaling (responsive) example.
    </dd>


    <dt><a href="distancePerception/"><b>Distance Perception</b>:</a></dt>
    <dd>Distances in Europe, as perceived by 1st year Geography students --
        Students overestimate distances to eastern-European cities compared to Southern-European ones...</dd>

    <dt><b>Tool to explore tracks withs stops</b>:</dt>
    <dd>Shows stops and distance travelled in different ways -- as map, as time and
        distance equally scaled, as time scaled dependent of distance and as distance scaled dependent of time. Currently the following tracks can be viewed:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="tracksViewer/napoleon.html">Napoleon's march on Moscow (Winter 1812)</a></li>
        <li><a href="tracksViewer/gpsTrack.html">Single GPS track of walk</a></li>
        <li><a href="tracksViewer/orienteering.html">Two orienteering runs</a></li>
        <li><a href="tracksViewer/busses.html">Multiple bus-trips on a bus-line</a></li>
      </ul>
    </dd>

    <dt><a href="TwenteRailroads/"><b>History of railroads in Twente</b>:</a></dt>
    <dd>This web-map shows the history of the railroads in Twente (a region in of Overijssel province, in the Netherlands).
        Moving the time-slider will show the changes through the years.</dd>

    <dt><a href="azimuth-distance/"><b>Measuring Distance &amp; Azimuth</b>:</a></dt>
    <dd>Explains how a Plate-Carr&eacute; projection can serve as a nifty tool
        to show bearing and distance from a location on Earth., where you would normally use a equidistant projection....</dd>

    <dt><a href="testFilter/"><b>D3 and Javascript data filter test</b>:</a></dt>
    <dd>Explains difference between JavaScript standard Array.filter() and d3.filter() function...</dd>

    <dt><a href="LangstonsAnt/"><b>Langton's Ant</b>:</a></dt>
    <dd>This is an implementation of Langton's Ant using HTML5 Canvas --
        Langton's ant is a two-dimensional
        Turing machine with a very simple set of rules but complicated emergent behaviour...</dd>
