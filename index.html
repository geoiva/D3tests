<h2>Site for standalone HTML5 (SVG, Canvas) and D3 experiments, tests and examples:</h2>

<dl>

    <dt><a href="azimuth-distance/">Measuring Distance &amp; Azimuth:</a></dt>
    <dd>Explains how a Plate-Carr&eacute; projection can serve as a nifty tool
        to show bearing and distance from a location on Earth., where you would normally use a equidistant projection....</dd>

    <dt><a href="tracksViewer/">Tool to explore tracks withs stops:</a></dt>
    <dd>Shows stops and distance travelled in different ways -- as map, as time and
        distance equally scaled, as time scaled dependent of distance and as distance scaled dependent of time...
        Examples shown are a GPS walk and Napoleons Moscow campaign.</dd>

    <dt><a href="testFilter/">D3 and Javascript data filter test:</a></dt>
    <dd>Explains difference between JavaScript standard Array.filter() and d3.filter() function...</dd>

    <dt><a href="distancePerception/">Distance Perception:</a></dt>
    <dd>Distances in Europe, as perceived by 1st year Geography students --
        Students overestimate distances to eastern-European cities compared to Southern-European ones...</dd>

    <dt><a href="LangstonsAnt/">Langton's Ant:</a></dt>
    <dd>This is an implementation of Langton's Ant using HTML5 Canvas --
        Langton's ant is a two-dimensional
        Turing machine with a very simple set of rules but complicated emergent behaviour...</dd>

    <dt><a href="RDproj_test/">Using projected coordinates:</a></dt>
    <dd>Map a geojson with cartesian coordinates, instead of lat-lon's (in this case the Dutch RD) --
        Uses an override of standard D3 geo projection behaviour:
        don't perform a full projection and resampling, but only a 1st order (affine) translation and
        scaling to transform real-world XY-coordinates into SVG screen coordinates...</dd>
